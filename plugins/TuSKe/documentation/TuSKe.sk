	Evaluate:
		ID: EffEvaluate
		Description:
			This effect will run any Skript effect/condition from a given string or piece of code. The difference between {{effects|EvaluateInputEffect|SkQuery effect}} and this is basically it returns all syntaxes errors instead of send them to the console, It can evaluate a long amount of code and see them easily instead of beeing in one line. 
For example, you can run a effect from a string, from a piece of code (without beeing quoted) or the entiry section of code.
Starting from 1.8, you can disallow some syntaxes when evaluating. Read more about it at config file (`TuSKe/config.yml`).
		Examples:
			set {_effect} to "send"
			evaluate:
				%{_effect}% "This message will be sent to a player."
			#Before parsing the code, it will convert all variables
			#To string, basically it will interpret the code above as it
			#was a whole string: "%{_effect}% ""This message will be sent to a player."""
			#where Skript will replace '%{_effect}%' with the variable value and then it will parse
			#The code. It is the same concept of Skript Options.
			 
			evaluate: kill all players #Not really needed for this but just an example
			evaluate: "broadcast ""Hi everyone"""
			evaluate:
				if true is true:
					give a diamond sword of %{Enchantment}% 1 to all players
			evaluate logging in {_errors::*}: this is not a valid effect
			if {_errors::*} is set:
				loop {_errors::*}: #If there is something wrong, it will add the errors here
					send loop-value
			#It will send a string in Skript default error format:
			<Error message>: <wrong expression> (TuSKe/evaluate.sk, line <line of code>, '<whole line>')
			'TuSKe/evaluate.sk' is a fictitious file, it doesn't exist.
		Since:
			1.7.5, 1.8 (filtering syntaxes)
		Patterns:
			eval[uate][ logging [[the] error[s]] in %-objects%][ with safety]: (%-strings%|<.+?>)
