	Parse:
		ID: ExprParse
		Description:
			Parses text as a given type, or as a given pattern.
			This expression can be used in two different ways: One which parses the entire text as a single instance of a type, e.g. as a number, and one that parses the text according to a pattern.
			If the given text could not be parsed, this expression will return nothing and the parse error will be set if some information is available.
			Some notes about parsing with a pattern:
			- The pattern must be a Skript pattern, e.g. percent signs are used to define where to parse which types, e.g. put a %number% or %items% in the pattern if you expect a number or some items there.
			- You have to save the expression's value in a list variable, e.g. set {parsed::*} to message parsed as "...".
			- The list variable will contain the parsed values from all %types% in the pattern in order. If a type was plural, e.g. %items%, the variable's value at the respective index will be a list variable, e.g. the values will be stored in {parsed::1::*}, not {parsed::1}.
		Examples:
			set {var} to line 1 parsed as number
			on chat:
				set {var::*} to message parsed as "buying %items% for %money%"
				if parse error is set:
					message "%parse error%"
				else if {var::*} is set:
					cancel event
					remove {var::2} from the player's balance

				parse error is set:
					message "&lt;red&gt;Line 1 is invalid: %last parse error%"
				else:

	Inventory Slot:
		ID: Slot
		Description:
			Represents a single slot of an inventory. Notable slots are the armour slots and furnace slots. 
			The most important property that distinguishes a slot from an item is its ability to be changed, e.g. it can be set, deleted, enchanted, etc. (Some item expressions can be changed as well, e.g. items stored in variables. For that matter: slots are never saved to variables, only the items they represent at the time when the variable is set).

Unlike item type an item can only represent exactly one item (e.g. an upside-down cobblestone stair facing west), while an item type can represent a whole range of items (e.g. any cobble stone stairs regardless of direction).
			You don't usually need this type except when you want to make a command that only accepts an exact item.
			Please note that currently 'material' is exactly the same as 'item', i.e. can have an amount & enchantments.
		Examples:
			set {_item} to type of the targeted block
			{_item} is a torch
		Usage: [&lt;number&gt; [of]] &lt;alias&gt; [of &lt;enchantment&gt; &lt;level&gt;], Where &lt;alias&gt; must be an alias that represents exactly one item (i.e cannot be a general alias like 'sword' or 'plant')

			An item type is an alias, e.g. 'a pickaxe', 'all plants', etc., and can result in different items when added to an inventory, and unlike items they are well suited for checking whether an inventory contains a certain item or whether a certain item is of a certain type.
			An item type can also have one or more enchantments with or without a specific level defined, and can optionally start with 'all' or 'every' to make this item type represent all types that the alias represents, including data ranges.
		Examples:
			give 4 torches to the player
			add all slabs to the inventory of the block
			player's tool is a diamond sword of sharpness
			remove a pickaxes of fortune 4 from {stored items::*}
